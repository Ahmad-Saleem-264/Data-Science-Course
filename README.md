Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured[1]. This course introduces methods for four key aspects of data science: 
* Data acquiring
* Data preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Modelling

### Is this course for me?
This course is designed for **graduates** from various fields.<br> 
So, if you are a student in, for example, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechatronics, Telecom Engineering, Social Sciences, Business,  etc., and want to learn some computational and quantitative skills to be successful in your field as it transforms in an age increasingly dominated by data and computation, this course might be for you!

This is an **advanced** course: we will introduce both programming concepts and the necessary mathematics.<br>
We expect you to have background in python programming and math. 

Their is no formal pre-requisite for the course because we are expecting a class of Graduate Engineers that are already acquainted with the right skills for the course.

### How do I enroll In This Class?

ITU students can enroll for the course by contacting the academics office.<br>
